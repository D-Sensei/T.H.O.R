T.H.O.R. - Tactical Hacking &amp; Offensive Response

Tactical Hacking & Offensive Response is a proactive approach that involves utilizing hacking techniques to detect and exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, with the aim of strengthening their defenses. By identifying potential threats and weaknesses before cyber attackers can take advantage of them, organizations can effectively respond with appropriate countermeasures.
# How I made it
1. Define the scope of the scanner: what types of malware will it detect, and where will it look for them?

2. Implement a scanner module that will search for files in the specified locations and analyze them for
malicious behavior. You can use Python libraries such as os, hashlib, and re to search for files, compute
hash values, and search for patterns in files.

3. Develop a malware signature database that contains the unique characteristics of known viruses. 
You can use this database to compare the hash values or patterns of the scanned files with those of the known malware.

4. Implement a quarantine or removal mechanism to isolate or delete the infected files.
